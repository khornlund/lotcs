Player Responsibilities
=======================

1. I'd like running D&D to be less of a one-sided time investment, so I'm going to ask that
   once a month you to all come round and help me prepare & paint minis for a few hours. I get a lot
   of joy from building up this collection of painted minis - and while Hugh's been kind enough to
   paint a bunch of stuff for me - there's only so much I can ask of him.
   Most of the work to be done isn't hard, just time-consuming. Hopefully since the sessions are
   infrequent, and we'll be doing it together, it shouldn't be too burdensome.
2. Be responsive. We'll use discord, so install it on your phone and turn push notifications on. If I message you on a platform other than discord about D&D, this is a sign you are not being appropriately responsive.
   If you usually have push notifications turned off because you don't want to be spammed by the other servers you're in, it's quite easy to mute each of those servers.
3. Follow the advice `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/veitej/how_to_make_your_dm_happy_in_6_relatively_easy/?sort=confidence>`_:
   a. Be engaded & have fun.
   b. Be prepared.
   c. Take notes.
   d. Build a character who will want to engage with the adventure.
   e. Share the spotlight.
   f. Take the spotlight.
4. Take quick turns. Stop counting squares and just do it!
