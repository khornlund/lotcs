Player Responsibilities
=======================

1. Be responsive. We'll use discord, so install it on your phone and turn push notifications on. If I message you on a platform other than discord about D&D, this is a sign you are not being appropriately responsive.
   If you usually have push notifications turned off because you don't want to be spammed by the other servers you're in, it's quite easy to mute each of those servers.
2. Follow the advice `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/veitej/how_to_make_your_dm_happy_in_6_relatively_easy/?sort=confidence>`_.
3. Take quick turns. Stop counting squares and just do it!
