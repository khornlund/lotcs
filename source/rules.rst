Resting
-------
Adventuring days will be pretty action-packed so we'll go with rules-as-written.

Administering Potions
---------------------
Using your action to administer a health potion to an unconscious creature requires going prone.

Prone
-----
Standing up from prone triggers attacks of opportunity.

Concentration
-------------
It's really hard for me to keep track of everyone's concentration, so I'd like there to be some penalty for players forgetting to keep track over their own. I'll remind you if I remember, but if we both forget and I remember later I'll have you roll at disadvantage.

Spell Components
----------------
You can use a focus instead of any material components that don't have cost requirements.

If you plan on having equipment in each hand (eg. shield + weapon, dual wield), I strongly recommend you take the Warcaster feat so we don't have to track whether you have a free hand for somatic components.

Disarming
---------
Not allowed because whatever you can do to enemies, they can do to you. It will be sad when goblins throw your magic sword in the lake.

Ability Checks
--------------

Passive Ability Scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DC to hide/stealth is the opponent's passive perception.

If your passive score meets the DC for a check you might automatically succeed after some period of
time (depending on the task). Eg. if you spend 10 minutes trying to lift something heavy.

Athletics
~~~~~~~~~
In general DEX is a more useful stat than STR, so to compensate:
most physical ability checks will use STR (Athletics) and not DEX (Acrobatics),
eg. climbing, jumping, etc.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
Checks to impersonate someone will use Performance. Eg. while under the effect of disguise self,
you want to impersonate the captain of the guard and issue a command to the militia.

Falling Damage
--------------
Falling damage increased to 1d8 per 10ft, up to a maximum of 50d8 at 500ft.

You can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to take half damage if you fall voluntarily.

Rolling Dice
------------

Invalid Rolls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rolls don't count if:

- you weren't asked to roll
- they fall off the table

Percentile Dice (d100)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PHB p6: "You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. **Two Os represent 100.**"
