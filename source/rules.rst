Crafting
--------
You will receive crafting materials as loot, and be able to harvest materials from certain enemies.
You can then craft these materials into items according to this
`crafting guide <https://drive.google.com/file/d/11tzfsTfjCR0rwIwN3wuvQyuZpl5K-0xq/view?usp=sharing>`_.
It will seem intimidating because it's a large document, but the rules are actually quite simple.
We'll ignore parts of it, and make some changes.

What I like about this is:

- It's a complete system that covers all the different kinds of crafting you might want to do,
  without being too complex.
- It's a player-driven system, where you can set your own goals and work towards achieving them over
  a number of sessions.
- It lets you craft cool things out of monsters you kill.
- It makes tool proficiencies worthwhile.

Things we're going to change/ignore:

- Named magical items are unique, ie. the party cannot craft two of the same thing.
  This is to help with balance. *Ring of Water Walking* it would be an example of a named magical
  item. Crafting 2x *Longsword, +1* would be fine.
- Ignore *Gathering*, because I think this will be boring. Note this makes herbalism less useful.
- Ignore *Cooking*, because all the items are homebrew.
- Ignore *Custom Weapons*, because you can't make them on dndbeyond.
- Ignore *Shelf Life* for alchemy, as long as you abide by the gentlemans' agreement not to hoard
  potions.
- Ignore *Alchemy Modifiers* and *Additional Materials* for alchemy, because I think they'll be a
  nightmare to keep track of.
- Ignore *Engineering*, because reasons.
- Ignore *Runecarving*, because it's all homebrew. I could be convinced to change my mind about this
  if it was really thematic, eg. if someone wanted to play a Rune Knight.
- Ignore all the homebrew items (GS, DS, TAG). As a general rule if it doesn't exist on dndbeyond
  you can't craft it.
- Ignore *Making Essences*.
- I will probably say no to some items. Do not build your character around being able to craft a
  particular item.

You can purchase mundane or common rarity materials in any town. You can purchase uncommon materials
in the large towns: Bryn Shander, Targos, Termalaine, and Easthaven.

Resting
-------
Adventuring days will be pretty action-packed so we'll go with rules-as-written.

Administering Potions
---------------------
Using your action to administer a health potion (or similar) to an unconscious creature requires
going prone.

Prone
-----
Standing up from prone triggers attacks of opportunity.

Concentration
-------------
It's really hard for me to keep track of everyone's concentration, so I'd like there to be some
penalty for players forgetting to keep track over their own. I'll remind you if I remember, but if
we both forget and I remember later I'll have you roll at disadvantage.

Underwater
----------
RAW:

*"When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural
or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin,
shortsword, spear, or trident.*

*A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against
a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a
net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).*

*Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.*

*A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds).*

*When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its
Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points
and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again."*

My homebrew additions:

- Wearing armor has no effect on your ability to swim.
- Wearing a shield halves your swimming speed.
- If you take damage while holding your breath, you must succeed on a concentration check. If you
  fail you lose 1 minute of air.
- You lose 1 minute of air each time you have to open your mouth, eg. cast a spell that requires
  verbal components.

Spell Components
----------------
You can use a focus instead of any material components that don't have cost requirements.

If you plan on having equipment in each hand (eg. shield + weapon, dual wield), I strongly recommend
you take the Warcaster feat so we don't have to track whether you have a free hand for somatic
components.

Disarming
---------
Not allowed because whatever you can do to enemies, they can do to you. It will be sad when goblins
throw your magic sword in the lake.

Ability Checks
--------------

Passive Ability Scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DC to hide/stealth is the opponent's passive perception.

If your passive score meets the DC for a check you might automatically succeed after some period of
time (depending on the task). Eg. if you spend 10 minutes trying to lift something heavy.

Athletics
~~~~~~~~~
In general DEX is a more useful stat than STR, so to compensate:
most physical ability checks will use STR (Athletics) and not DEX (Acrobatics),
eg. climbing, jumping, etc.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
Checks to impersonate someone will use Performance. Eg. while under the effect of disguise self,
you want to impersonate the captain of the guard and issue a command to the militia.

Falling Damage
--------------
Falling damage increased to 1d8 per 10ft, up to a maximum of 50d8 at 500ft.

You can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to take half damage if you fall voluntarily.

Rolling Dice
------------

Invalid Rolls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rolls don't count if:

- you weren't asked to roll
- they fall off the table

Percentile Dice (d100)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PHB p6: "You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered
from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones
digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. **Two Os represent 100.**"
